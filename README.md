# SoICT-2019
A research project on how to take advantage of the citizens to create a smarter city that can respond quickly and effectively to anomalies such as residential fires or urban floods.

The project has two contributions:
  * A system that automatically handle images provided by the citizens, in order to effectively deal with anomalies. The system makes use of a classifier based on MobileNet to identify anomaly events in the supplied images. The classifier can currently classify 5 types of events, can be easily extended, and currently has an accuracy of 92.3%.
  * A dataset of approximately 10000 images of both anomalies and non-anomalies in Vietnam. The purpose of the dataset is to assist research into anomaly handling specific to Vietnam.
